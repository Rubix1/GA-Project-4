Academic and operational excellence are at the heart of what we do. Combining a smart, digitally focussed mentality with an unrelenting dedication to student outcomes we are redefining post graduate education.   ABOUT THE ROLE Reporting directly to our COO, AIB is looking for a superstar to fill the newly created role of Performance Insights Analyst. At AIB, we love data. In fact, we love it so much that we have absolutely masses of it and the time has come for the COO to close her 47 Excel tabs and find a specialist to take over the reins. The Performance Insights Analyst will ferret through our masses of data to find the nuggets that deliver better performance and better student experiences. It’s a role with real impact – it’s not about creating masses of reports that no one will ever read. It’ll require curiosity, a willingness to challenge the status quo and a tonne of patience and persistence. Working in Excel, SQL, Power BI, Salesforce or their very own abacus, they don't need to be a data scientist (but if they are, awesome!) but they will need to have a solid grounding in data analysis - ideally within a call centre, an educational institution, financial services or any other complex service type business. Practically (after all, we are the practical business school!) the Performance Insights Analyst will:  Create useful data sets that reflect the customer and student journeys accurately – which means linking data from multiple systems Use these datasets to analyse key parts of the student or customer journeys – and then turn that analysis into useful, actionable insights that remove friction or improve the experience. Setup and then maintain testing frameworks – so we can tell if initiatives are working or hypotheses are proven (or disproven) Devise, implement and maintain a system of identifying lead performance indicators - allowing us to quickly course correct or take advantage of new opportunities. Most importantly, they'll need to get to understand our business, embrace our somewhat organic approach to ideas (!?) and want to be part of an ambitious team on a mission to transform how students engage with education.   TO APPLY Are you our perfect match?  Then, please click ‘apply’ and submit your resume and brief covering letter addressing your suitability for the role.

The Opportunity  Reporting to Dr. David Croucher the research officer is a part of the Network Biology research group.  Many of the current generation of cancer therapeutics target components of signalling pathways, being either small molecule kinase inhibitors or monoclonal antibodies to cell surface receptors. Whilst these individual proteins and pathways represent attractive therapeutic targets, it is fast becoming apparent that the inherent flexibility of signalling pathways mean that targeting a single pathway component can lead to rapid network adaptation and the emergence of a resistant sub-population of tumour cells.  The Network Biology research group focuses on the investigation of network level aberrations induced by oncogenes and oncogenic mutations, ultimately aiming to elucidate how these altered network states lead to therapeutic resistance  Key ResponsibilitiesExperience in the following procedures is essential:Maintenance and monitoring of rodent coloniesFluorescent intravital imaging of rodent models, including imaging within the lungSurgical implantation of titanium windows for intravital imaging of the lungRecord experimental procedures and results;Preparing research manuscripts and grant proposalsRegularly attend meetings with the wider Research Program community as requiredResponsible for imparting knowledge in relation to limited skills or experimental expertise in generalAbout You  In order to be successful in this position, you will demonstrate the following key skills and attributes:A PhD in an appropriate area of medical research;Team-focused approach;High degree of flexibility;Ability to take direction wellShowing ability to time manageAppropriate prioritisation of workloadGood communication skillsComfortable with independent decision makingAustralian citizen, permanent resident or current visa that allows up to 3 years of employment.How to Apply  All applications must include a cover letter along with your resume with at least 2 referees.

711,PhD Scholarship in Machine Learning for radar image analysis,"Macquarie University and Defence Science and Technology (DST) are offering this PhD scholarship for up to 3.5 years study at Macquarie University.  Macquarie University, located in Sydney’s Macquarie Park Innovation District, is a leading Australian University.  DST is the second largest publicly funded research organisation in Australia, responsible for applying science and technology to safeguard Australia (dst.defence.gov.au). The scholarship is funded and supported by DST. Role and Benefits As a PhD scholar, you will be responsible for developing innovative methods as described below for recognising sea vessels based on their radar signatures.  Your research will encompass machine learning methods, including deep learning, applied to this task.  You will have regular interaction with DST personnel as well as Macquarie University staff and students, and will receive supervision to support you in your research. You will have opportunities to present your research in national and international conferences and journals. You will develop research skills in data science (specifically in machine learning) which is an area of rapid growth and high demand in IT. The scholarship provides $40,000 pa tax free for up to 3.5 years, plus money for travel. Upon successful completion, you will be awarded a PhD from Macquarie University. Research Topic The research topic is recognition of sea vessels from their signatures in ISAR (Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar) images using machine learning - especially “deep learning”.  ISAR obtains images of targets from radar, utilising the movement of the target to create the synthetic aperture.  The available data is limited, so techniques for learning from low data volumes and synthetic data generation are likely to be relevant.  Radar signatures vary for the same vessel depending on direction of travel and also on wave conditions, so the machine learning solution needs to generalise across these sources of variation.  The problem is known to be challenging and has, to date, mostly been addressed through traditional manually designed feature classification methods.  Deep learning and related methods offer the potential to automatically extract appropriate features for classification. Requirements The applicant must be an Australian citizen.  The applicant should have an honours or research masters degree in computer science, engineering or mathematics. A background in machine learning would be beneficial. The selected applicant will apply for admission to PhD at Macquarie University as the preferred applicant for this scholarship.","['Try the app', 'PhD Scholarship in Machine Learning for radar image analysis', '3 Feb 2020', 'Sydney', 'Full Time', 'Education & Training', 'Share this role', '3 Feb 2020', 'Sydney', 'Full Time', 'Education & Training']"

Research Topic The research topic is recognition of sea vessels from their signatures in ISAR (Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar) images using machine learning - especially “deep learning”.  ISAR obtains images of targets from radar, utilising the movement of the target to create the synthetic aperture.  The available data is limited, so techniques for learning from low data volumes and synthetic data generation are likely to be relevant.  Radar signatures vary for the same vessel depending on direction of travel and also on wave conditions, so the machine learning solution needs to generalise across these sources of variation.  The problem is known to be challenging and has, to date, mostly been addressed through traditional manually designed feature classification methods.  Deep learning and related methods offer the potential to automatically extract appropriate features for classification. Requirements The applicant must be an Australian citizen.  The applicant should have an honours or research masters degree in computer science, engineering or mathematics. A background in machine learning would be beneficial. The selected applicant will apply for admission to PhD at Macquarie University as the preferred applicant for this scholarship.","['Try the app', 'PhD Scholarship in Machine Learning for radar image analysis', '3 Feb 2020', 'Sydney', 'Full Time', 'Education & Training', 'Share this role', '3 Feb 2020', 'Sydney', 'Full Time', 'Education & Training']"

950,PhD Scholarship: Remote monitoring of high-speed catamarans,"The Research Project Australia is the world leader in the design and manufacture of state of the art large aluminium ferries, and Incat Australia Pty Ltd (Incat) is one of the dominant builders of these vessels in the international market. Research is required to increase reliability, seakeeping and passenger comfort of Incat vessels by improving vessel design, systems and performance in relation to the key operational conditions of vessel speed and random wave characteristics. To satisfy these overarching design requirements, this Project aims to:  Establish an ongoing ship monitoring system to remotely measure vessel motions and structural loads, exploiting cloud technology to obtain real time-data on vessel performance. Improve structural efficiency by analysing large datasets at full-scale using sophisticated statistical methods to more accurately predict the peak wave loads acting on the vessel. Improve passenger comfort by extensively investigating and interpreting the motions response of the vessel and ride control activity under commercial operating conditions. Develop a “Smart” semi-autonomous interface to provide on-board seakeeping guidance to the operator in moderate and rough seas to increase ship safety, vessel longevity and improve passenger comfort.
